        "Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python, designed to help developers build web applications quickly and with minimal overhead. It's often described as a micro-framework because it doesn't include many built-in features like a full-fledged web framework might (such as Django). Instead, Flask provides the essentials, and developers can add extensions as needed to suit their project's requirements. Key Features of Flask: Simplicity: Flask is easy to set up and use, making it ideal for small to medium-sized projects. Flexibility: It doesn't impose a specific project structure or require any particular libraries, allowing developers to choose the tools and libraries that best fit their needs. Built-in Development Server: Flask comes with a built-in server for development purposes, making it easy to run your application locally. Jinja2 Templating: Flask uses the Jinja2 template engine, which allows developers to generate HTML dynamically using templates. RESTful Request Handling: Flask simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs by providing tools to handle HTTP requests, route URLs, and manage responses. Extensibility: Flask's modular nature allows developers to integrate various extensions for adding features like database handling, form validation, and authentication. Basic Example: Hereâ€™s a simple 'Hello, World!' application using Flask."
